An effort is made to pick\r\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\r\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary\r\n * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to\r\n * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to\r\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\r\n * primary.\r\n *\r\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\r\n * operations.

So in addition to attempting to give up the\r\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\r\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\r\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\r\n *\r\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\r\n * longer optional.\r\n */\nclass __PRIVATE_IndexedDbPersistence {\n  constructor(\n  /**\r\n   * Whether to synchronize the in-memory state of multiple tabs and share\r\n   * access to local persistence.\r\n   */\n  e, t, n, r, i, s, o, _, a,\n  /**\r\n   * If set to true, forcefully obtains database access.

The Query Engine determines\r\n * what mode to use based on what data is persisted. The mode only determines\r\n * the runtime complexity of the query - the result set is equivalent across all\r\n * implementations.\r\n *\r\n * The Query engine will use indexed-based execution if a user has configured\r\n * any index that can be used to execute query (via `setIndexConfiguration()`).\r\n * Otherwise, the engine will try to optimize the query by re-using a previously\r\n * persisted query result. If that is not possible, the query will be executed\r\n * via a full collection scan.\r\n *\r\n * Index-based execution is the default when available. The query engine\r\n * supports partial indexed execution and merges the result from the index\r\n * lookup with documents that have not yet been indexed. The index evaluation\r\n * matches the backend's format and as such, the SDK can use indexing for all\r\n * queries that the backend supports.\r\n *\r\n * If no index exists, the query engine tries to take advantage of the target\r\n * document mapping in the TargetCache. These mappings exists for all queries\r\n * that have been synced with the backend at least once and allow the query\r\n * engine to only read documents that previously matched a query plus any\r\n * documents that were edited after the query was last listened to.\r\n *\r\n * There are some cases when this optimization is not guaranteed to produce\r\n * the same results as full collection scans. In these cases, query\r\n * processing falls back to full scans. These cases are:\r\n *\r\n * - Limit queries where a document that matched the query previously no longer\r\n *   matches the query.\r\n *\r\n * - Limit queries where a document edit may cause the document to sort below\r\n *   another document that is in the local cache.\r\n *\r\n * - Queries that have never been CURRENT or free of limbo documents.\r\n */\nclass __PRIVATE_QueryEngine {\n  constructor() {\n    this.$i = !1, this.Ui = !1,\n    /**\r\n     * SDK only decides whether it should create index when collection size is\r\n     * larger than this.\r\n     */\n    this.Wi = 100, this.Gi =\n    /**\r\n    * This cost represents the evaluation result of\r\n    * (([index, docKey] + [docKey, docContent]) per document in the result set)\r\n    * / ([docKey, docContent] per documents in full collection scan) coming from\r\n    * experiment [enter PR experiment URL here].\r\n    */\n    function __PRIVATE_getDefaultRelativeIndexReadCostPerDocument() {\n      // These values were derived from an experiment where several members of the\n      // Firestore SDK team ran a performance test in various environments.\n      // Googlers can see b/299284287 for details.\n      return isSafari() ? 8 : __PRIVATE_SimpleDb.v(getUA()) > 0 ? 6 : 4;\n    }();\n  }\n  /** Sets the document view to query against. */\n  initialize(e, t) {\n    this.zi = e, this.indexManager = t, this.$i = !0;\n  }\n  /** Returns all local documents matching the specified query. */\n  getDocumentsMatchingQuery(e, t, n, r) {\n    // Stores the result from executing the query; using this object is more\n    // convenient than passing the result between steps of the persistence\n    // transaction and improves readability comparatively.\n    const i = {\n      result: null\n    };\n    return this.ji(e, t).next(e => {\n      i.result = e;\n    }).next(() => {\n      if (!i.result) return this.Hi(e, t, r, n).next(e => {\n        i.result = e;\n      });\n    }).next(() => {\n      if (i.result) return;\n      const n = new QueryContext();\n      return this.Ji(e, t, n).next(r => {\n        if (i.result = r, this.Ui) return this.Yi(e, t, n, r.size);\n      });\n    }).next(() => i.result);\n  }\n  Yi(e, t, n, r) {\n    return n.documentReadCount < this.Wi ?

This allows multiple browser tabs to read and write to IndexedDb and\r\n * to synchronize state even without network connectivity. Shared access is\r\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\r\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\r\n *\r\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\r\n * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick\r\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\r\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary\r\n * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to\r\n * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to\r\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\r\n * primary.\r\n *\r\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\r\n * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of\r\n * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence\r\n * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see\r\n * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from\r\n * persistence.\r\n *\r\n * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary\r\n * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as\r\n * the addition of new mutations and query targets.\r\n *\r\n * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary\r\n * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent\r\n * operations will automatically fail.\r\n *\r\n * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the\r\n * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make\r\n * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary\r\n * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\r\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\r\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\r\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\r\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\r\n *\r\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\r\n * longer optional.\r\n */\r\nclass __PRIVATE_IndexedDbPersistence {\r\n    constructor(\r\n    /**\r\n     * Whether to synchronize the in-memory state of multiple tabs and share\r\n     * access to local persistence.\r\n     */\r\n    e, t, n, r, i, s, o, _, a, \r\n    /**\r\n     * If set to true, forcefully obtains database access.

The Query Engine determines\r\n * what mode to use based on what data is persisted. The mode only determines\r\n * the runtime complexity of the query - the result set is equivalent across all\r\n * implementations.\r\n *\r\n * The Query engine will use indexed-based execution if a user has configured\r\n * any index that can be used to execute query (via `setIndexConfiguration()`).\r\n * Otherwise, the engine will try to optimize the query by re-using a previously\r\n * persisted query result. If that is not possible, the query will be executed\r\n * via a full collection scan.\r\n *\r\n * Index-based execution is the default when available. The query engine\r\n * supports partial indexed execution and merges the result from the index\r\n * lookup with documents that have not yet been indexed. The index evaluation\r\n * matches the backend's format and as such, the SDK can use indexing for all\r\n * queries that the backend supports.\r\n *\r\n * If no index exists, the query engine tries to take advantage of the target\r\n * document mapping in the TargetCache. These mappings exists for all queries\r\n * that have been synced with the backend at least once and allow the query\r\n * engine to only read documents that previously matched a query plus any\r\n * documents that were edited after the query was last listened to.\r\n *\r\n * There are some cases when this optimization is not guaranteed to produce\r\n * the same results as full collection scans. In these cases, query\r\n * processing falls back to full scans. These cases are:\r\n *\r\n * - Limit queries where a document that matched the query previously no longer\r\n *   matches the query.\r\n *\r\n * - Limit queries where a document edit may cause the document to sort below\r\n *   another document that is in the local cache.\r\n *\r\n * - Queries that have never been CURRENT or free of limbo documents.\r\n */\r\nclass __PRIVATE_QueryEngine {\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        this.$i = !1, this.Ui = !1, \r\n        /**\r\n         * SDK only decides whether it should create index when collection size is\r\n         * larger than this.\r\n         */\r\n        this.Wi = 100, this.Gi = \r\n        /**\r\n * This cost represents the evaluation result of\r\n * (([index, docKey] + [docKey, docContent]) per document in the result set)\r\n * / ([docKey, docContent] per documents in full collection scan) coming from\r\n * experiment [enter PR experiment URL here].\r\n */\r\n        function __PRIVATE_getDefaultRelativeIndexReadCostPerDocument() {\r\n            // These values were derived from an experiment where several members of the\r\n            // Firestore SDK team ran a performance test in various environments.\r\n            // Googlers can see b/299284287 for details.\r\n            return isSafari() ? 8 : __PRIVATE_SimpleDb.v(getUA()) > 0 ? 6 : 4;\r\n        }();\r\n    }\r\n    /** Sets the document view to query against. */    initialize(e, t) {\r\n        this.zi = e, this.indexManager = t, this.$i = !0;\r\n    }\r\n    /** Returns all local documents matching the specified query. */    getDocumentsMatchingQuery(e, t, n, r) {\r\n        // Stores the result from executing the query; using this object is more\r\n        // convenient than passing the result between steps of the persistence\r\n        // transaction and improves readability comparatively.\r\n        const i = {\r\n            result: null\r\n        };\r\n        return this.ji(e, t).next((e => {\r\n            i.result = e;\r\n        })).next((() => {\r\n            if (!i.result) return this.Hi(e, t, r, n).next((e => {\r\n                i.result = e;\r\n            }));\r\n        })).next((() => {\r\n            if (i.result) return;\r\n            const n = new QueryContext;\r\n            return this.Ji(e, t, n).next((r => {\r\n                if (i.result = r, this.Ui) return this.Yi(e, t, n, r.size);\r\n            }));\r\n        })).next((() => i.result));\r\n    }\r\n    Yi(e, t, n, r) {\r\n        return n.documentReadCount < this.Wi ?
